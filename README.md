# Manual

## Description
A wizard from the Otherside who mastered the magical power of music. He can gain superhuman powers by playing music discs in walkman, playing a noteblock or blowing goat horns. Due to an unfortunate accident Melomanian got lost in the Overworld, losing all his magical music discs that give him superhuman powers. There's still hope for him. He must set off for a journey to recollect all the discs and return to his home world!
How does this work?
The powers you obtain depend on which disc is played. The powers will last as long as the record is played.
In order to play a disc you need to press a [primary key] button (the default key is [G]) while holding that disc in your main hand. After that the music starts playing, a disc disappears from your inventory and a bar with a note icon appears above your hunger bar. It shows how much time is left until the music ends. When the music finishes, the disc returns to your inventory and a bar with an hourglass appears which shows how much time is left before you can use another disc again. The cooldown lasts 2 minutes.

NOTE! YOU CAN’T USE MULTIPLE DISCS AT THE SAME TIME

## WARNING!
## This data pack adds sequences of flashing lights and quickly changing imagery and may not be suitable for people with photosensitive epilepsy.

## 13
This disc turns you into a ghost

Immortal - you’re invincible when not material. Nothing can kill you

### Cons:
Immaterial - you can’t harm anybody when you’re immaterial. Only when you’re in possession mode or you are material you can interact with other entities. You can’t also eat, so you can’t restore your hunger bar. However you don’t exhaust yourself when immaterial.

Susceptible to potion effects - negative effects (instant damage, poison, slowness, weakness, blindness, unluck, wither) materialise you. This means that others can see you and can hit you. When the effect is over, you turn back into a ghost.

## 5
This disc covers you in sculk.
### Pros: 
Bonus xp – you get 2x more xp when killing a mob

Sonic boom – you can attack mobs and players from distance by releasing sonic boom. The range of sonic boom is 13 blocks and deals 10 points of damage. Because you’re smaller than a Warden, sonic boom repulses you backwards, which might be problematic, but also has some advantages (for example you can rocket jump)
Sculk spreading – while holding an echo shard in your main hand you can spread sculk around you

No vibrations – you emit no vibrations, which means sculk sensors and Wardens cannot detect you

Warden's ally – Wardens treat you like their friend as you are covered in sculk. They can’t hurt you.

### Cons:
Darkness – you have darkness effect, but not for all the time. When the record has a short segment of calm, relaxing music, the effect wears off.

Covered in sculk – you can’t wear a helmet, because your head is covered in sculk

## 11
You don’t want to know what this disc does. TRUST ME!

You also have two additional powers that don’t require a disc to be activated.


# Magical music
The power of music can heal many wounds. Become a composer and make music that will brighten others’ day.

In order to use the power you must start playing on a note block. Hold it in your offhand. Then use the [number keys] to play - your toolbar becomes a keyboard. When you start playing, a bar with a note icon appears above your hunger bar. It indicates how many notes you have played. To unleash the true potential of magical music, you must play until the bar is full. When it happens, you enter the state of a musical trans. In this state, you can heal everyone, who is in the range of 32 blocks from your position. While in musical trans, you start to levitate and if you keep playing, you’re accompanied by magical notes appearing around you every time you play a note and flying into the air until they explode like fireworks.

The default sound of a note block is a harp. However, you can set other instruments or mix several of them to make more catchy sounds. In order to do that, press a [command key] button (/). After that, a menu will appear in your chat. There are 16 different sounds: banjo, bassdrum, bass, bell, bit, chime, cow bell, didgeridoo, flute, guitar, harp, hat, iron xylophone, pling, snare, xylophone. To add a sound to the list of active sounds, click on an [Add] button next to the selected sound. To remove a sound from the list, click on the [Remove] button. You can also remove all sounds from the list by clicking on the [Remove all] button. Every time you change the list of active sounds, an updated list will show up in your chat.

# Mystical horns

By playing a goat horn you can summon mystical creatures and phenomenons. Depending on a tune the goat horn emits you can get different results. Some can be useful, some adorable, and some can bring chaos to the Overworld. So remember to use them wisely.
In order to summon creatures/phenomenons, you need an artefact (a necessary item). Some goat horns require to drop the items on the ground, some must be held in offhand. To summon, hold a goat horn in your mainhand and play it.
Entities you can summon and necessary items [(d) – drop on the ground, (h) – hold in offhand]:
Ponder = 4x blue Axolotl = 32x Spore blossom (d)
Sing = 4x Allay = 64x Amethyst shard (d)
Seek = 1x Iron golem = 16x Iron ingot + 1x Carved pumpkin (d)
Feel = 1x Lightning bolt per each entity = 16x Lightning rod (h)
Admire = 1x ring of Fangs = 16x Pointed dripstone (h)
Call = 1x TNT per each entity = 16x TNT (h)
Yearn = Four Horsemen = 64x Bone + 4x Skeleton skull (d)
Dream = 1x Illusioner = 1x Totem of undying + 1x Skeleton skull (d) 


# Welcome to Otherside – the world of Melomanians
## Lore
It’s the place where Melomanians come from. A peaceful world filled with music. Thanks to Otherside disc Melomanians were able to visit the Overworld. You are one of them and probably the last. You entered the Overworld through a portal but due to a dramatic accident all of your discs were destroyed, including Otherside. Now you’re stuck int the Overworld. However there’s hope for you to return to your home. Your ancestors left many discs here, in Overworld. If you find the key to your home, you’ll be saved.
Description
Otherside is a peculiar place. It’s devoted to music, so everything what you find there is related to melody. Mountains and cliffs with staffs on their sides and magical colorful notes, which play nice tunes when gathered. There are bells hanging from the tallest oak trees. In caves you can find lots of amethyst, crystals and wind bells made of iron, copper, gold and rarely diamond and even netherite (these are really hard to find). There are noteblocks in some places. They can be avctivated if you walk close to them, as underneath them sculk sensors are located. In the high mountains you can find pilars made out of cobbled deepslate and tinted glass. They represent the highest tones. Melomanians constructed many buildings and monuments in honour of music. You’ll encounter huge monuments of instruments, an amphitheatre in shape of drums, a pyramid with synthesizers on top and worship places which lead you to the Overworld.
How to open portals?
If you’ll be lucky enough and find one of worship places, you’ll be able to open a portal to Overworld. The only thing you need to do is play Otherside disc in the jukebox in the middle. Before You get your disc back from the walkman you need to stay inside the circle marked out by stone pillars. The place of worship is a sanctuary, which doesn’t allow you to return to Overworld when Otherside disc stops playing. After you get this disc, put it inside the jukebox.
Important! As Melomanian you can’t walk through the portal when you have any disc playing in your walkman and when a bar with an hourglass is active.


That’s all you need to know about this origin. It’s the second origin I’ve made so far and quite a big one. The whole process of creating 1.17 version took me like 2 months (of course I wasn’t writing codes non-stop XD I’ve got other things to do) and 1.18.2 version was also a really long work (especially creating a new dimension – I recommend WafflesAreBetter’s videos on YouTube about dimensions, they helped me a lot!). If you like this origin please leave a reaction to the post on the datapack channel on Origins Discord server, I would really appreciate it :D
If you spot some bugs feel free to DM me. I’d like to know if there’s something that needs a change or doesn’t work properly.
Also check my previous origin: Froster

Hope you enjoy the origin
