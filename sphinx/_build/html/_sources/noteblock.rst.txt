Magical music
=============

The power of music can heal many wounds. Become a composer and make music that will brighten others' day.

In order to use the power you must start playing on a note block. Hold it in your offhand. Then use the **[number keys]** to play - your toolbar becomes a keyboard. When you start playing, a bar with a note icon appears above your hunger bar. It indicates how many notes you have played. To unleash the true potential of magical music, you must play until the bar is full. When it happens, you enter the state of a musical trans. In this state, you can heal everyone, who is in the range of 32 blocks from your position. While in musical trans, you start to levitate and if you keep playing, you're accompanied by magical notes appearing around you every time you play a note and flying into the air until they explode like fireworks.

The default sound of a note block is a harp. However, you can set other instruments or mix several of them to make more catchy sounds. In order to do that, press a **[command key]** button (``/``). After that, a menu will appear in your chat. There are 16 different sounds: 


#. **banjo**, 
#. **bassdrum**, 
#. **bass**, 
#. **bell**, 
#. **bit**, 
#. **chime**, 
#. **cow bell**, 
#. **didgeridoo**, 
#. **flute**, 
#. **guitar**, 
#. **harp**, 
#. **hat**, 
#. **iron xylophone**, 
#. **pling**, 
#. **snare**, 
#. **xylophone**.
