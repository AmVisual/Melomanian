Who's Melomanian?
=================

Melomanian is a wizard from the Otherside dimension who mastered the magical power of music. They can gain superhuman powers by playing music discs in a jukebox, playing a noteblock or blowing goat horns. Due to an unfortunate accident Melomanian got lost in the Overworld, losing all their magical music discs that give him superhuman powers. But there's still hope for them. They must set off for a journey to recollect all the discs and return to their home world!
